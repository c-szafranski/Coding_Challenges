The problem was given in a Computer Science class to build a compressor/ decompressor by 
implementing a Huff Tree. 

I was not in the class at the time but thought it would be worth a shot to implement it.

The main class is found in TEST.java there with the modification of the path to the file one could
run the compressor/decomressor which for now will both compress and decompress the given input file.
